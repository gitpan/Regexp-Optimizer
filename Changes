$Revision: 0.12 $ $Date: 2004/05/04 17:12:14 $
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm
  Perl 5.8.4 and later corrected a bug so it is fatal to go
    my $x = qr{ ... (??{ $x }) ... };
  under "use strict".  Unfortunately Regexp/Optimizer.pm had two
  occurances thereof.  Now fixed.

  Version jumps to 0.10 do to radical changes, especially in
  $Regexp::Optimize.
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm t/02-list.t t/03-utf8.t
  Aagh!  Why didn't I come up with such a simple idea !?
  ->optimize is completely rewritten.
  t/*.t is streamlined to reflect changes.
  Now ->optimize() *really* optimizes even for
  qr/(?:1|12)|123/.  Used to return qr/1(?:2?|23)/ but now it
  returns qr/1(?:23?)?/o
! Regexp/Optimizer.pm  Regexp/List.pm
  POD enhanced.
